<h3 class="content_title"> Who We Are </h3>

<p>Originally founded in 1985, no other major precious metals and coin dealer has operated under the same name and in the same location as long as Merit Financial. Located on the third floor of the Wells Fargo building in Santa Monica, Merit is a division of Seacoast Coin, Inc., a privately owned company which has never been bought or sold. This lets Merit keep their focus where it belongs: helping clients meet their precious metals needs.
